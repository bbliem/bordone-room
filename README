Don't forget:

pip install --user git+https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool.git

Forget that, I forked it and made some modifications:

pip install --user git+https://github.com/bbliem/pyexiftool.git

Also, the version of django-autoslug in PyPI does not support Django 2. For now:
pip install --user git+https://github.com/justinmayer/django-autoslug
